# MachineLearningDiscrimination
Context: Alarming increase in Crime rates are matter of concerns in Baltimore. This study includes plotting the crime incidents from Baltimore Police Department Victim based crimes, applying Kernel Density Estimation Algorithm on the co-ordinates of crime incidents to estimate the probability density function, and how this algorithm is used for plotting future crimes based on geocoded data, and also plotting the gender and race distribution using Baltimore census data. Visualizing the hotspots of crimes, the law enforcements can detect the crimes and prevent the occurrences.
Objectives: The study focuses on plotting crime incidents on the Baltimore map, generating heat maps based on the density of crimes, applying Kernel Density Estimation on the incident co-ordinates and predicting the future possible events and understanding the race and gender distribution among the neighborhoods so as to possibly establish the fairness in the algorithm. 
Methods: The study includes certain key methods to improve the accuracy of the results, Box Plot is used to remove the outliers of crime data, HeatMap from folium is used to generate the heatmaps of the crimes based on the incidents and geopandas is to plot the crimes on the Baltimore map, KDE is generated as  2D for longitude and latitude, also plotted on the map to visualize the density.  KDE is applied on the crime records to generate the sample for real time and for the police and BallTree from geopy is used to detect the crimes that is within 100 meters range of police.
Results: The crime incidents predicted by the Kernel Density Estimation algorithm are plotted, race and gender distribution is plotted on the Baltimore map to detect any discrimination of the algorithm and these incidents are compared with incidents generated by the police Kernel Density Estimation, for an incidents that is within certain distance of police KDE are analyzed and evaluated to prevent crime occurrences.
Conclusions: The study concludes the application of Kernel Density Estimation algorithm on the co-ordinates of the crime incidents and predicting the real time crime events and how effectively the KDE can be used by the Police department to predict the approximate crime location, use the location to prevent the crime occurrences and use the Baltimore census data to merge the Population distribution to understand how biased the algorithm.
